## Overview

I picked up this challenge because I am trying to hone my Front-End skills which has been wonderful doing it. I met with quite number of challenges but I kept getting through the help of God.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See all testimonials in a horizontal slider
- Receive an error message when the newsletter sign up `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

This project took me appropximately 3 days with quite different types of challanges such as making it responsive while I maintain the background images, the Image Carousel, the Navigation Bar, getting the correct fonts e.t.c It is indeed a challenge for me to hone my skills.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 Modern Design
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
-JavaScript


### What I learned

```css
html{
    background-image:url(../manage-landing-page-master/images/bg-tablet-pattern.svg);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: bottom 45% left -350px;
    background-size: 50%;
    font-family: rocko;
}
```
```js
 slides[slideIndex-1].style.display = "block";  
  dots[slideIndex-1].className += " active";
  setTimeout(showSlides, 3000);
```
### Continued development
I will love to develop my JavaScript skills and being able to develop myself that I can do this type of website in a minute.
